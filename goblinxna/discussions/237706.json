However, I was wondering why there are no tutorials in the library that make use of markers and physics (Newton/Havok) at the same time. A simple example could be virtual\r\n balls falling on a virtual board and bouncing off it. The transform of virtual board should be dependent upon the pose of the marker in the real world.</p>\r\n<p>I think it will help everyone using GoblinXNA a lot! Since through pictures on your website and videos on youtube, it can be seen that you already have developed complicated physics/AR examples, a simple tutorial showing a simple example as mentioned above\r\n would be of great help to us...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again and best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Wetoo</p>\r\n",
