I mean if I only want to play a portion of the video, I don't have a way (or at least I don't know) to do it.</p>\r\n<p>Let say if I want to jump in and start play from the middle of the video instead of the beging and then end the video somewhere before the ending of the video. I have been trying to figure out if there is a work around but couldn't find anything.</p>\r\n<p>I also consider to integrate VLC to the app, but seems can't find a clue to start?</p>\r\n<p>If anyone has done this or any clue, please help to share?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
