    "Html": "<p>Do you have more than one camera device (both virtual and physical) attached to your camera? In Goblin XNA, you need to indicate which camera to use by passing the camera ID in the InitVideoCapture function. By default, Tutorial 8 uses ID 0. If you have more than one camera, then the ID can be from 0 to (# of camera - 1). Try other IDs if you don't see any image. If the ID is above the # of devices available, it'll throw an exception indicating that it's out of range.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
