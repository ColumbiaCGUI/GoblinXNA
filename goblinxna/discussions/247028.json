(Do I build&nbsp;markerlayout&nbsp;because&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I do, it give me \"unsafe\" errors- LayoutManager.cs on lines 353 and 608 and ImageReader.cs line 348 or is it a class that i call)</p>\n<p>But bottom line is I just want to create a marker array thats 1x4 (using alvar tag ids 101-103 ) and display the cube on it, similar to the one in tutorial 8 but instead of the ground array i am using my own.</p>\n<p>Also I know this is a stupid question but since I am so confused right now, if your only tracking one marker do you need .xml the and .txt files because to my understanding you would just put in your marker ID in&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;field below.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>MarkerNode(IMarkerTracker, (int) markerID, (double) markerSize)</p>\n<p>Thanks in&nbsp;advance,</p>\n<p>Jay-ar</p>",
