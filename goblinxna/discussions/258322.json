    "Html": "<p>Are you going to do marker tracking? If not, you can simply change the RenderFormat (it only has get property, so you need to change the source code in Goblin XNA) of your capture device (e.g., DirectShowCapture) to flip horizontally. If you're doing marker tracking, it'll be more complicated since this flipping will not affect the image passed to the marker tracker. You will have to change your capture device's GetTexture(...) method as well for the IntPtr data.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",

For example, when I move my left arm to left, the me in the  monitor does the same thing to my right. So, what I'm trying to say is: Is it possible to have web camera collect marker data, and have another(virtual) camera attached to the marker(on my forehead :D ) so I could see my moves from 1st person?</p>\n<p>In short, what I'm trying to say is: Is it possible to have a primary virtual camera if physical camera is on and watching markers?</p>",
