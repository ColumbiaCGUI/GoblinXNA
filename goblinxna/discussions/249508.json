    "Html": "<p>Hi, thank you for answer, I was debugging my code, I noticed that it is wrong only when I use fbx. model like modelNode, some my model don't change tranformation but some do. In 3ds max I set for every model position 0,0,0, and when I&nbsp; give these modelNode  to markerNode, fallen cubes are on the different place (for different models).&nbsp; When I try set for example ((TransformNode)dominoNode.Parent).Translation = new Vector3(0,90,0); It was ok with using some models, there is some trans, but I want for all my model  to have the same behavior, maybe I have to set something for model to not change my transformation. Because when I have position new Vector(0,0,0) every model is displayed exactly on the marker but some of them change position fallen cubes, some not. I don't understand why or how it has affect when I use some fbx model on position fallen cubes.</p>\n<p>Monika</p>",

When I give directly to code where I work with model model \"thonet\", and I give this model to transNode and markerNode, in  other class I give boxes for board game to transNode and markerNode, and then I run application with models, text information, boxes and so on, I can see this image ﻿﻿﻿<a href=\"http://img217.imageshack.us/i/boxesb.png/\">http://img217.imageshack.us/i/boxesb.png/</a>,  when I change directly&nbsp;in source code model \"thonet\" on different&nbsp;model and I run application I can see this image ﻿<a href=\"http://img8.imageshack.us/i/boxes2.png/\">http://img8.imageshack.us/i/boxes2.png/</a>.
