I can ensure that i haven't modified the source code from the tutorial. However, the marker recognition works fine but i can see the scene twice like its on both, the right and the left display. How do i fix this issue or where does it come from. Is it usual that the resolution of the displays are that bad that i cannot even read text from my monitor ? The resolution is a problem i can live with but i really want to figure out how to use the Tutorial that i can only see the scene once.\r<br />\n<br />\nregards\r<br />\n<br />\nLordTribual<br />\n",
