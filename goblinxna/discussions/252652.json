But when I try to use the same function in my own program, the text appears jumpy. It kind of looks like there are\r\n two of the same texts written over the other but at slightly different locations. I want it to be written relative to marker, so I've been doing the following:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>UI3DRenderer.Write3DText(&quot;Hello World&quot;, vectorFont, UI3DRenderer.Text3DStyle.Fill, Color.Red, marker.WorldTransformation);</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any help you can provide as to how to resolve the jitter, would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
