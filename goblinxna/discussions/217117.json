    "Html": "For now, it's probably best to draw the screen saver texture yourself using a SpriteBatch. Make sure to draw after base.Draw(...) call so that your screen saver will be rendered after whatever Goblin renders so that your screen save overwrites Goblin rendering. \r\n\r\nbase.Draw(....);\r\n\r\nspriteBatch.Begin();\r\n\r\nspriteBatch.Draw( // your texture here );\r\n\r\nspriteBatch.End();\r\n\r\nI haven't had time to look into the program, but it's probably due to texture size mismatching between the capture device and your screen saver image.\r\n\r\nOhan",
