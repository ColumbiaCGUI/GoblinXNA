    "Html": "<p>It actually may not work with regular Model class right now. I've only tested with PrimitiveModel types for shadow mapping, if I remember correctly since that's what I needed for my research purpose. In any case, make sure scene.ShadowMap is not null first of all. If that's not a cause of an issue, then there's probably some bug in the SimpleShadowShader. In that case, please send me your teapot model so that I can do more testing later on. It'll probably be after ISMAR deadline though (late May)</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Well yes it works perfectly on primitiveModel types like spheres boxes and stuff like that. Anyway I added more models to scene like boxes and shadows appeared, but as soon as I assign shader to model from Max it crashes. And about that teapot model it's  just a simple teapot exported from Max in fbx format. I was trying to make it work first and then I would move on with my vehicle model I did earlier. <br />I found that shadows in version 3.6 works fine so I switch back to it, or maybe there is a simple way to use that *.fx in 4 version?, but probably it require shader recompiling since it is different VS and PS versions.<br /><br /> Thank you for answer anyway :).</p>",

XNA 4.0 is strict on the requirement of what vertex contains (normal, color, texture coord, binormal, etc) so you will need to extend&nbsp;MultiLightShadowMap.fx for regular model with whatever vertex info is included. We only needed simple primitive models, so I didn't create bunch of .fx that works with regular models.</p>\r\n<p><span>Ohan</span></p>",
