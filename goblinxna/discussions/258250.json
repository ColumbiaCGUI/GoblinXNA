Actually that resolution is sharp enough for me, but it's still the wrong aspect ratio. So i wonder if it's possible to\r\n crop the captured video image before i display it to the scene. If i have my application in a different resolution than my camera image, the scenegraph just scales the image to fill the screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm not afraid to alter the source code for goblin, but considering future upgrades i'd rather not change anything just yet.</p>\r\n<p>cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Freek Jan</p>\r\n",
