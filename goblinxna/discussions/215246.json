But no such project exists in my alvar folders. I've ran Alvar 1.3.0/build/msvc90/generate.bat and&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvar 1.3.0/build/msvc90/build/Alvar.sln.bat, which were supposed to generate this project, but they unfortunatly did not. I'm probably missing something increadibly simple here,, but I can't figure out what this is. I've redownloaded and installed alvar 3 times, I've gone through all the subfolders (and those of GoblinXNA aswell to be sure) multiple times in search of something executable or a project or sln file, but without luck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The web did not offer much of a solution either as most sources see,ed to simply assume that the file is there.</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>",

I had similar problem when I run generate.bat in 64-bit Windows 7 machine, so what I usually do is run it on an XP machine, and then transfer the generated project files to my 64-bit Windows 7 machine (it requires directory changes in the .proj files though), but I believe this is CMake issue rather than ALVAR. I'm pretty sure running generate.bat on a 32-bit XP machine will properly pop up CMake, and asks you to input the proper directories to find GL and OpenCV headers and libraries. I don't know if this is the case for 64-bit XP or Vista machine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
