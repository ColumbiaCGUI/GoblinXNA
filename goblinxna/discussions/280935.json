I could see it moving but I am still not ableto achieve what I am intended to do.<br />I want the sphere to appear just on top of the marker and move along with the markerwhen I physically move the marker. Now the sphere appears some where else on the screen.&nbsp;When I move the marker, the sphere moves but not on the same pace. At some point the&nbsp;marker starts overtaking the sphere on the screen.</p>\r\n<p><br />Thanks.</p>",
