I've followed the installation guide carefully, had problems with AlvarWrapper.dll (not found) which I believe I've managed to solve... but now I get an AccessViolationException\r\n message when calling:</p>\r\n<p>ALVARDllBridge.alvar_add_multi_marker(markerConfigName)</p>\r\n<p>I haven't been able to find the answer in the discussions. I'm using windows 7 64 bits and Visual Studio 2010 (which may be the cause). Another detail is that after all this I tried using depends.exe on AlvarWrapper.dll, and it can't find gpsvc.dll or ieshims.dll.\r\n I can't simply copy these into the unmanaged folder, they're found in Windows\\System32</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions? Thank you in advance</p>\r\n",
