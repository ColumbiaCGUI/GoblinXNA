It's still in development phase, and not officially released yet, but you can contact him directly if you're interested in learning what is exactly supported by ARMAR toolkit and when it is expected to be publicly available.</p>\r\n<p>Goblin is flexible enough to support many types of applications. The only limitation is that you can run Goblin only in XNA supported platforms (currently, only Windows based OS)</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
