When I try to use newton physics to move the ball when I tilt the marker, the ball won't move. I tried to just using newton\r\n (not with AR), i load a box (as the ground) and put some balls above it, when I tilt the box the ball move. I am very confused how to move the ball when I tilt the marker, any help would be appreciated.. thanks before :)</p>\r\n",

You basically need to change the direction of the gravity based on the orientation of the marker board as well as the vuzix iWear. So yes, you will need the vuzix iwear to make it work perfectly. Otherwise, you have to make an assumption of which direction your camera is facing.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
