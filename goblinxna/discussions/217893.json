All the relevant files have been installed and the tutorials are functioning perfectly,  I have also performed the instructions as Alvar stated (open generate .bat and Alvar.sln.bat).\r\n\r\nAfter reading the following discussions -\r\n\r\n' http://goblinxna.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=76359 ' -\r\n\r\nThis will prompt myself with samplemarkercreatord.exe is not a vailid internal or external command ? ( alvar does contain a .cpp file that has no output once compiled ?).  But i am unsure of what to expect as an output ?.\r\n\r\nAlso this discussion -\r\n\r\n' http://goblinxna.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=210553,',\r\n\r\nWhich appears to have got a lot further than i have but no explanation to how ?,\r\n\r\nI have also read the installation and user manual aswell as searching for literature on Alvar but havnt got any closer, I was hoping someone could introduce me to some documentation on how the process should work ?, or explain how the process should go ?, as i think i am at a loss and am working towards a deadline.  \r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\n**edited post**",

However, if you're having problem with ALVAR installation, I won't be able to help much, and you need to contact VTT.\r\n\r\nOhan",
