Tao framework</p>\r\n<p>3. freeglut.dll</p>\r\n<p>When you compile Goblin XNA, make sure to remove the Tao stuff from the references, and remove ARTagTracker from the Device.Vision.Marker directory in the solution explorer of VS 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Then, when you compile the tutorials, you should remove ARTagWrapper.dll from Tutorial 8 and Tutorial 13 as well as the freeglut.dll.</p>\r\n<p>Then in the code, remove the place that has ARTagTracker.</p>\r\n<p>I'll try to make these a little bit easier for the next release.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
