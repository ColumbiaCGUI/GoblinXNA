This one should implement IMarkerTracker found in&nbsp;GoblinXNA.Device.Vision.Marker. Then if you add that one as a tracker to your scene and if your math is allright, it should work. You should be expecting official support for opencv 2.1 in the next 2 months. (note: this is just my estimation. I'm not an official developer for goblin or anything)</p>",
