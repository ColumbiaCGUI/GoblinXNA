Is there a way to have that window remain while also having the video streamed to the goggles display? The only solution I've found\r\n is to clone the screen so I can visualize it on both. But I don't care to see my computer screen on the goggles. I want to only see the camera view on my goggles and a camera view in its own window on my computer.</p>\r\n<p>I'd appreciate any help you can give me.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Natalie</p>\r\n",
