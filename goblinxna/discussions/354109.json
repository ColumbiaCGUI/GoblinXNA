So could someone help me to add correct physical movement to the model?</p>\r\n<p>I have taken a look at the Advanced Physics tutorial but it is overly complex. Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The version of Newton we currently support doesn't have that functionality (their latest release may support, but I don't know), but I know that Havok and Matali physics support what you want to do. Those functionality is supported through MataliPhysics and HavokPhysics, so please look though the code for a hint of how to do it. You should also look into their (Havok or Matali) documentation to better understand it.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
