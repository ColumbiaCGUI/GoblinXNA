I have tried making a custom animated model in blender with a single armature bone and the problem\r\n is once I export it to Goblin and try to start the project I get the following exception:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (skinningData == <span style=\"color:blue\">null</span>)\n <span style=\"color:blue\">throw</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> GoblinException(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;This model does not contain a SkinningData tag.&quot;</span>); \n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Now this is an already textured custom model and is exported with xna strict options, I also made sure that the content processor is set&nbsp;to the right SkinnedModelProcessor value, so then what could be the issue?&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
