The thing is that they are appearing somewhere (the ball counter is going up) but I cannot see them. Positioning\r\n the camera in a wierd way the balls appear, but they do not shoot out, it's like they just fall down from the camera (mostly missing the marker)</p>\r\n<p>I thought someone had the same problem and can help me out here. I've been through the tutorials and everyting else seems fine.</p>\r\n",
