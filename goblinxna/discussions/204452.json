I would prefer using ALVAR, but i dont know how to code in it, and i don't know how to get an ALVAR application ready to code for AR. Also, i would like it to be like an MMO (Short for MMORPG which stands for Massivly Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). The Game would need to be multiplayer and have a login screen. A game concept i had in mind, though i would never copy anything from would be EVE Online. One more extrordinary feature is using the Vuxiz VR920.</p>",
