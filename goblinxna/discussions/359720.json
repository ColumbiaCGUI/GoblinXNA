My assumption is that to make it possible MataliPhysics code should be using the IPhysics interface. I end up to be so frustrated because I don't find any ways to integrate\r\n that. I think MataliPhysics could be the best physics engine to be used with GoblinXNA. It is managed and the forum is so active.</p>\r\n<p>Somehow today I found your source code which use MataliPhysics and it is already ready to be used with GoblinXNA. I've checked back the manual, installation guide and also the API documentation there are no evidence of MataliPhysics at all.</p>\r\n<p>How am I going to use MataliPhysics for my project? pls help</p>\r\n",

However, we haven't released MataliPhysics to the public yet since we haven't released the Windows Phone support for Goblin XNA due to the lack of license-compatible tracking library written in C#.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We may release the WinPhone support in our next release without any tracking capability, and in that case, we'll release MataliPhysics support as well. The next release is expected to come out by the end of June with ALVARWrapper 2.0 support.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
