If you set scene.EnableShadowMapping to true, you should also include the ShadowMap.fx and PostScreenShadowBlur.fx in data/Shaders and&nbsp;ShadowDistanceFadeoutMap.dds in data/Textures into your project Content directory.</p>\r\n<p>For the glossiness, you may need to write your own shader, such as for reflections. The one you see in the video uses the original racing game's NormalMapping shader, which is not included with the release. You can see how your can create your own shader and use it with Goblin XNA from Tutorial 11. It's best you extend the current Material class to include anything extra that you use in your shader (e.g., bump map textures), and set the GeometryNode.Material to your extended class. It'll then be passed to your shader automatically.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
