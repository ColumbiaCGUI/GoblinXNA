Alvar1.4 requires me to use Visual C&#43;&#43; 2008 to compile the source into alvarwrapper.dll<br>\r\nI lost my image for Visual Studio 2008, but I still have C# 2008 installed. I also have the Visual Studio 2010 image. But alas, Alvar wants me to open it in 2008. If I try to convert it to 2010 I eventually hit an error when building dll. I have slow internet,\r\n so it'd take me a week or so to download the image once more, which I don't really want to do.</p>\r\n<p>TL;DR: Can someone upload the dll file, so I can just put it in the unmanaged directory?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>\r\nNaartjie&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

If youre not experienced with goblin at all, i'd recommend you to stick with the 2008 version as theres still some small issues with the new version. (shadowmapping for example).</p>\r\n<p>Can't you just download the visual c++ express edition? its a 300mb download or something.</p>",
