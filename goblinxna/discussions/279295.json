For example: if (state.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right)){ models = &quot;model2&quot;; CreateObjects(); }</p>\r\n<p>Can i delete the <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\"><span>previous model from the scene? or maybe i must to create a lot of Nodes for each Model and delete and add it later to the scene???=</span></span><br>\r\nI know that something is wrong... but am i ok with my <span id=\"result_box\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<span>philosophy?
