The mp3 player has a Start button, Pause Button and Stop button. The code is designed to play music on the click of a mouse button on the start button, puse the music on the cick of pause button, etc. I wonder if the same can be achieved through human interaction instead of mouse. For example, can I play the music by &quot;touching&quot; the start button with my hand. It would require some kind of motion detection. Does anybody have any idea whether such a thing can be achieved?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Anshu Dutta</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
