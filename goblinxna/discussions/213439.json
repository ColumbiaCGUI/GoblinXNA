Please make sure that you use the right version of ALVAR (1.3.0) and the wrapper code (ALVARWrapper1.3).\r\n\r\nThe SimpleCamCalibMarker should be as long as I know. If it's missing, please contact VTT. \r\n\r\nI don't think SampleMultiMarkerBundle works with basic version of ALVAR. I think they only allow it in pro version.\r\n\r\nOhan",
