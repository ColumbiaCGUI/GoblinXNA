Cause I don't need one, only a marker..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now have 4 markers in the corners of a paper sheet, and need to find the relative position of a marker inside those four. What funciton can i use to find the pos of a marker wihtout having a geometry node associated.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks a lot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaetitia Mendes<br>\r\n",
