    "Html": "Dear Buskerone!<br />\n<br />\nSorry for the late reply, I had a lot of works in these weeks.<br />\n<br />\nI used to add these lines that you write, but it doesn't work yet. I think the GoblinXNA can't render shadows with animated models, so we have to wite an own fx file to manage animated model shadows, but i don't know how to do that. I asked a lot of times in this forum how to add animated model shadow, but no one replied. :((<br />\n<br />\nI didn't made animated models in 3DS Max, so I don't know how to do that. When I add animated model to my project I made some separated elements of the model and I animated these elements by code, like wind turbine etc. The wind turbine was 2 elements, and I rotate the turbine by code. <br />\nIf you want to animate models in the modelling programs (3DS Max or Maya), you have to add bones to your model.<br />\nRead this article how to do that in Maya:<br />\n<a href=\"http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:user:henderso:tutorials:fbxtoxna\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:user:henderso:tutorials:fbxtoxna</a><br />\n<br />\nI searched but I didn't find article about how to make animated models in 3DS Max to GoblinXNA, if you find some, please share with me. :)<br />\n<br />\nBye and sorry again. ;)<br />\n",
