We'll release it after they release their 'release' version since the compilation instruction will change quite a bit from their beta version. However, please be warned that as of beta version, the feature-based tracking is not very stable compared to their marker-based tracking. For ALVAR, I would suggest sticking with their marker-based tracking since it's much better than any other libraries, but for feature-based one, unless they will have lots of improvements for their actual release, I wouldn't say it's very useful.</p>",
