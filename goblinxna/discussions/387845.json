Instead of click on this button, I can just use voice command and&nbsp;pronounce&nbsp;&quot;Next&quot;. Dragon Naturally Speaking will click on the button for me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have other c# app that I wrote having a button of type System.Windows.Forms.Button. This app is working ok with Dragon Natuarally Speaking. I also check other desktop application in windows and they all work with this voice command application.</p>\r\n<p>I don't know if G2DButton need to implement anything else in other for it to work with this Dragon?</p>\r\n<p>Anyone try this yet?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
