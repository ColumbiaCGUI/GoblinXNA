Goblin gives a warning saying that &quot;one of the meshes has no skinning data&quot;, whereas the model seems to be correctly skinned.</p>\r\n<p>Have anybody already successfully imported an animated mesh from 3DS Max?</p>\r\n<p>Here is the .fbx file, can somebody see what's wrong with it?</p>\r\n<p>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=714I5GU8</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for reading me and for your help.</p>\r\n",
