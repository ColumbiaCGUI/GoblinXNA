    "Html": "<p>Hi ssnh,</p>\r\n<p>Due to a change for place where I update the marker node transformations, now ARTag does not work if State.IsMultiCore is set to true (which is by default). So if you're using ARTag, then you need to explicitly set State.IsMultiCore to false (which makes it run much slower).</p>\r\n<p>However, there is a way to make ARTag work with State.IsMultiCore true, but you need to make changes to Goblin XNA framework as discussed here: <a href=\"http://goblinxna.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=72346\">http://goblinxna.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=72346</a>&nbsp;.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
