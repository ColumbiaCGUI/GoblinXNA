    "Html": "Hi Ohan,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I was referring to the translation component of an object attached to a marker.  Apologies for the ambiguity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you've probably already guessed, I was under the impression that objects still adhered to global coordinates even when attached to a marker.  This is obviously not the case, so thanks for straightening this out for me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll go and have a play around, keeping the marker coordinate system behaviour in mind.  This may generate some more questions so I may need to keep this discussion alive for a little while longer :) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n** I've actually just removed quite a lengthy question because I want to get all my facts straight first ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers<br>\r\nSimon<br>\r\n",
