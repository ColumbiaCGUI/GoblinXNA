Does this part work on xbox360, and is it allowed to take it out of this package and use only this part of the engine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nkind greetings, Bart<br>\r\n",

However, the GUI parts were written assuming keyboard and mouse inputs are used, so the event handling is done through keyboard and mouse. If you're going to use it for Xbox, you need to rewrite the event handling part using the Xbox controller interface.<br>\r\nÂ <br>\r\nOhan\r\n",
