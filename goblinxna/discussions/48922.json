I'm aware of how the ARTag marker library works and the ARTag website says there's a generating function in the SDK rev2k but I've read the included docs and so far haven't found any clues yet. I guess I can copy-paste from the existing ground and toolbars to create new sets but still prefer a function to ease the process.\r\n",
