The problem that I am having is that the Z dimension in the marker node configuration doesnt work, we tried different configurations but changing the Z didnt affect the result. I was wondering if anyone has done something like this, I dont know if we are doing something wrong or if there is a problem with ArTag.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

Unfortunately, there is no commercial or licensed version for ARTag now, so you won't be able to find a public version that supports Z coordinate.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
