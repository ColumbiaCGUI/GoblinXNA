I downloaded a GPU monitoring app and when i running my app it shows that, the GPU doesn't work (only the CPU counting the objects), so how can i use the GPU for rendering?</p>\r\n<p>My other problem is when i working with 1280x720 images, the processing is too slow (i5 CPU) and it only uses 1 core from out of 4. So my question that how can i make the program multi threaded? Or is that any kind of idea how can i increase the performance\r\n for higher resolution capturing?</p>\r\n<p>At least there is another question. :) I solved the shadow problem for non-primitive models, but the shadow are too hard and it's resonating (with primitive models too, like in the domino game and tutorial 8). How can I make much smoother and non-resonating\r\n shadows?</p>\r\n<p>I know that theese are so difficult questions, but if you can write it in few sentence, i will say &quot;BIG THANKS&quot; :)</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for all the helps, You and Columbia University rocks! ;)</p>\r\n",
