How do I rotate my model around another point ?\r<br />\n<br />\nOf course I know that I have to translate it first and rotate after that but its not working. Im trying to do the rotations with Quaternions. \r<br />\n<br />\nHow does it work when I want to rotate around one axis. I already found out that i have to use something like Quaternion.CreateFromAxisAngle but its not rotating around its own center. I want to rotate a single object around its own center.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan someone help me please ?\r<br />\n<br />\nregards\r<br />\n<br />\nLordTribual<br />\n",
