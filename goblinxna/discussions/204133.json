When running tutorial 8 I have put the printout of groundALVAR.pdf on my desk and set the camera from a stationary position a few feet away. I am able to see the green sphere and the red cube but they are constantly moving around the screen erratically and scaling seemingly randomly. Is this a sign that I need to regenerate my calib.xml file? Also, I have a Logitech Webcam C500 could this be an issue?</p>",
