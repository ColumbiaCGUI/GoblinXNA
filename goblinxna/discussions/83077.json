I think I have downloaded correct tools needed to compile GoblinXNA. all of the required libraries are successfully built but I have doubt in some of the libraries because I think as if I cheated the way I compiled it.</p>\r\n<p>For newton and lidgren they were smooth. DirectShow.Net package was a bit problematic. First I couldn't get the package from the site provided in the Installation Guide, therefore I searched for it elsewhere. I managed to find it. However I didn't know whether that package was OK. Anyway I managed to get its DLL and eventually copied it into the GoblinXNA\\bin folder.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Then it was ALVAR. Building it was a pain in the &quot;tut&quot;. Firstly I got lots of errors and warnings. Then I found out that it was the library and include path. i corrected it. then comes the problem with <em>cxcore.lib. </em>I couldn't find it anywhere. Finally, I changed a file in C:\\OpenCV\\lib folder from <strong><em>libcxcore200.dll.a </em><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">to </span><em>cxcore.lib</em><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">. And then I managed to build and get the ALVARWrapper.dll straight away. The rest was good.</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Then I opened C# to compile GoblinXNA I got 3 errors and 1338 warnings. Until now I can't find what is wrong. Please help</p>",
