Since it works fine for regular webcam, I believe it disposes for VGA2USB as well.</p>\r\n<p>One possibility is that it takes a while to start from the 2nd time. The mechanism I use to detect whether the capture device is used by another application or not is to try to connect to the capture device for a constant number of times (I believe it's set to 1000 at the moment, and you can see this number in DirectShowCapture). If it fails to access within this number of times, it'll assume it's used right now since there is no other way to tell. For certain camera devices, it takes time to dispose and restart, which won't usually happen with a regular webcam. If this is the case for you, you can increase the number used to large number instead of 1000. Try to see if this solves your problem.</p>\r\n<p>By the way, I won't have much time from now on since I need to finish my Ph.D thesis.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
