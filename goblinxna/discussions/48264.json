The problem is that if you have only VS 2008 installed, it won't work because the ARTagWrapper.dll is not compiled under VS 2008, and it depends on some of the libraries included with VS 2005. If you have both VS 2005 &amp; 2008 installed, then you won't see this error message. We have a solution for this, but we're waiting for Mark Fiala's response on this issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nOhan\r\n",

If so, is the property of ARTagWrapper.dll in the solution explorer set to &quot;copy if newer&quot; in the output option?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solution I mentioned before is that we wrapped the ARTag C++ library ourselves and compiled under VS 2008. Then the ARTagWrapper.dll works fine using standalone VS 2008 installation. But from what I see from the error message (I didn't see the error message in details before, so I assumed the problem was VS 2008 issue), it sounds like it's not this VS 2008 issue since it's a different error message. It sounds like a linking error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nohan\r\n",

I've also tried installing all the 2005 and 2008 redistributable packages but nothing has worked yet. Can you give me your copy of artagwrapper.dll then ?
