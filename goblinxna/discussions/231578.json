It is a truly remarkable library for game development!</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, My name is Michael Pitre. I am a&nbsp; 5th year game design student in college who is attempting to create a RTS game with XNA game studio. Goblin XNA caught my eye because I wanted to implement the game play within recorded video,, similar to video tracking.</p>\r\n<p>My question is, can the library support recorded video as a interactive environment for applications developed with Goblin XNA? Or does this library only support live video tracking? If so for the first option, how can I go about implementing that action within my game</p>\r\n<p>framework?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Michael T Pitre</p>",
