You should always just do &quot;Build Solution&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that I set the tutorials up so that it's copying the files (e.g., Newton.dll) from bin to bin (basically to the same directory), and if you do either Rebuild or Clean, VS will first delete those files, and then try to copy them to bin. Obviously, it will try to copy something that it just deleted. If you don't like this behavior, please copy the resource files such as Newton.dll to some other folder, or change the destination directory of the tutorials to some other directory (e.g., bin/Debug under Tutorial 1 directory). I made everything to stay in the bin directory just to make things look clean.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",
