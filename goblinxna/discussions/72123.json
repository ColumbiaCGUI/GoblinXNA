    "Html": "<p>Hi kdodman,</p>\r\n<p>Since the tool bar only has two markers on it, the tracking tend to be quite jerky when using ARTag. ARTag performs better when there are multiple visible markers. With the new release (which will be posted shortly), ALVAR does much better job with fewer markers. There are pros and cons between ARTag and ALVAR.</p>\r\n<p>Ohan</p>",

But I'm having issues with the markerlayout program you have made. It seams to make everything massive, even if I change the pixels per ich down to 0.1f or so. I dont want a 40 by 40 inch marker lol.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And another note, I&nbsp;generated a pile of artag marker images, but when i use those i seam to get an error when running your program.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Your crop area's X position is outside of the marker size&quot; or the X demension error. the only thing I change is the image it loads. and from what I can tell the images I generated are the same&nbsp;dimensions&nbsp;as the ones you have in there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
