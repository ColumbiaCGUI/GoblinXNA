<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />Goblin XNA is a platform for research on 3D user interfaces, including mobile augmented reality and virtual reality, with an emphasis on games. It is written in C&#35; and based on Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.1 &#40;up to Goblin XNA v3.6&#41; and 4.0 &#40;after Goblin XNA v4.0&#41;.<br /><br />The latest stable release is <b>Goblin XNA v4.1</b> released on <b>6/27/2012</b>. <u><b>This distribution includes the support for Windows Phone 7</b></u>. However, we did not include in our distribution any classes or tutorials that use vision-based tracking on Windows Phone, since we currently know of no tracking library for Windows Phone that is compatible with our BSD license and with the use of packages for which source code is not available. We will include support for vision-based tracking on Windows Phone once an appropriate library becomes available.<br /><br /><b>If you&#39;re interested in receiving information regarding Goblin XNA (e.g., new releases), please send an email to goblinxna@gmail.com with a subject line &quot;SUBSCRIBE&quot;.</b> If you want to unsubscribe after subscribing, then send an email with a subject line &quot;UNSUBSCRIBE&quot;.<br /><br /><u>If you use Goblin XNA for your project, and publish any webpages or videos, it&#39;ll be appreciated if you could mention that your software is developed using Goblin XNA framework.</u><br /><br />Goblin XNA <a href="http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/projects/goblin/">http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/projects/goblin/</a> uses a scene graph to support 3D scene manipulation and rendering, mixing real and virtual imagery. 6DOF (six-degrees-of-freedom) position and orientation tracking is accomplished using the ALVAR marker-based camera tracking package with DirectShow or PGRFly (for Point Grey cameras), and InterSense hybrid trackers. In addition to regular desktop and hand-held computer displays, Goblin XNA also supports the Vuzix iWear VR920 head-worn display in monoscopic and stereoscopic modes, along with its 3DOF orientation tracker. Physics is supported through the Newton Game Dynamics library, and networking through the Lidgren library. Goblin XNA also includes a 2D GUI system to allow the creation of classical 2D interaction components.<br /><br />Here are the videos of some interesting games we have developed using Goblin XNA:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7ao3izQQI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7ao3izQQI</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1xaRrfgTk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1xaRrfgTk</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AKgH4On65A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AKgH4On65A</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_LrVqI6StY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_LrVqI6StY</a><br /><br />If you would like to contribute to this project, please contact me at ohan@cs.columbia.edu. We are especially looking for people who can develop more sophisticated shaders that can enhance augmented reality (better shadow mapping, reflection, water effect, etc).<br /><br /><i>Goblin XNA was funded in part by a generous gift from Microsoft Research.</i><br /><br /><i>This material is also based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0905569.</i><br /><i>Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.</i><br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=goblinxna&DownloadId=169110" alt="armonica.jpg" title="armonica.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=goblinxna&DownloadId=156364" alt="armable.jpg" title="armable.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=goblinxna&DownloadId=156363" alt="ardomino.jpg" title="ardomino.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=goblinxna&DownloadId=156365" alt="armodeler.jpg" title="armodeler.jpg" /><br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=goblinxna&DownloadId=156366" alt="arracing.jpg" title="arracing.jpg" /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
